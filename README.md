## What is growth mindset?
### Growth mindset is the ability to be able to grow utilizing one's drive and craving for knowledge as opposed to just being naturally good at something.
### Growth mindset is a positive example that even though some individual's might be born with natural abilities that make them better suited for a task does not mean that individuals who are not naturally inclined to succeed are completely ruled out from the challenge.
