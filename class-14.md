# CSS

## Transform property
* Comes in two different settings
- two - dimensional 
- three- dimensional
* Both three and two dimensional come with their own values and properties
- Browser support for the (Transform) property isn't great but is getting better each day.

### Transform syntax

> The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
- The stated property will utilize various vender prefixes in its syntax in order to gain more browser support 
- The un-prefixed versions comes last in case a browser does fully support the transform property

* 2 dimensional work on both the x and y axis
* 3 Dimensional work on the x, y and z axis.  Helping define not only the length and width but also the depth.

* The transform property accepts various values
- Rotate (360)
- Scale value within the (Transform) property allows you to change appeared size of image
> It is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and scaleY values.

- 2D Translate

>The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
- 2D Skew 


# Transitions and Animations

- The ability to design animations with HTML and CSS without having to utilize javascript and the older Flash.

# Simple Transitions that have a big display

* Many use the `:hover` after the element to activate but not all
* Some have code snippets that just need to be inserted

- Fade In
- Change Color
- Grow & Shrink
- Rotate Elements
- Square to circle 
- 3D Shadow 
- Swing

* There are various changes that can be made to style or animate the button.  These changes could help catch a users attention or to just give the interface a little razzle dazzle.


> There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

* Animations Keyframes
>To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

- Animation Name
- Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay

* Customizing Animations
- Animation Iteration (by default animation runs once from beginning to end)
- Animation Direction
- Animation play state (allows animation to be played or paused)
- Animation Fill Mode (how animation should be styled before/after or both after an animation is run)

* Shorthand Animations
- Animations can be written out in shorthand format
