# Reading - 401 - Class - 3


## Vocab
### Term

- Middleware - Code that runs before that final route callback.  They sit between the initial route and the callback function.

- Request Object - represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers.

- Response Object - Represents the HTTP response taht an express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

- Application Middleware - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object(req), the response object (res) and the next function in the applications request-response cycle.

- Routing Middleware - When using Express it can become common practice to make end-points that use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) requests.  What Router does is manage the incoming requests.  Routes requests to correct handler/code

- Test Driven Development - A process of developing and runnning automated tests before the actual development of the application itself.

- Behavioral Testing - Uses human-readable descriptions of user requirements as the base for software test.

> Classes are templates for making objects They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

- Class declaration 
>One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class 

- An important thing to take note is that the main difference when declaring a function or a class is that functions declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not

## Routing

- Routing refers to how an applicaitnos endpoints respond to client requests

> You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).
- app.use() to utilize middleware as a callback
- app. app() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use()

- Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

- Normal Route Structure: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

* app is an instance of express.
* METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
* PATH is a path on the server.
* HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

# New ExpressJS 4.0 with new tools

## Router

> Express 4.0 comes with the new Router. Router is like a mini express application. It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route.

> The app.METHOD() function is used to route an HTTP request, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request, such as GET, PUT, POST, and so on, in lowercase. Thus, the actual methods are app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and so on.

* Syntax:

>app.METHOD(path, callback [, callback ...]) Parameters:

* Path: The path for which the middleware function is invoked and can be any of:
- A string representing a path.
- A path pattern.
- A regular expression pattern to match paths.
- An array of combinations of any of the above.

* Callback: Callback functions can be:
- A middleware function.
- A series of middleware functions (separated by commas).
- An array of middleware functions.
- A combination of all of the above.
