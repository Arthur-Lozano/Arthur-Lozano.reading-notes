## This exercise taught me how to utilize visual code and to use it in conjuction with vs code to push data to github.

### I have learned a lot from the reading such as cloning repositories to my local machine will help me to edit my content before I ACP it back to github.  I have also learned the lessons below.

* Check file status
* Tracking and staging a file
* Committing a new file
* Pushing final changes


## Absolute/Relative paths 
* Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the **root** directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
* Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in *relation to where we currently are in the system*. They will not begin with a slash.


# Helping build paths
> ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
. (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
.. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
