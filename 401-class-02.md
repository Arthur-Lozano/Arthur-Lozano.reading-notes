- What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

* The main difference between PUT and Patch methods is that PUT uses the request URI in order to supple a modified version of the original requested resource which will then replace the original resource.  Patch method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

- Three services or tools that allow me to "mock" an API for development are listed below.

- Patch will fix the data you want to fix specifically and PUT might require you to change other data in the process of changing the data you initially intended to change.

## Swagger vs APIDoc

- It seems to me that swagger might be better because of the popularity that goes along with it.  This popularity causes developers to utilize it more and therefore making it grow as a tool each day.  If a developer is using Dotnetcore then the APIs files are already 80% compatible which means less work.  APIdoc.js offers documentation on the conversion process from APIdoc to Swagger due to popularity.

### Swagger

* The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the main purpose of Swagger.

- Open Source framework with a large ecoystem of tools that helps us software developers design, build and Restfeul web servers.
- Swagger helps us describe the structure of our APIs so that machines can read them.
- Similar to XML schema but for Json
- API documentation website for one's API
- Swagger description and guidelines of API endpoints can be found.
- Swagger can be used to keep API endpoints and descriptions.
- Free and purchase packages
- The most popular tool to fully leverage the power of the OAS across the API lifecycle.
- 404, 401, 404, 5xx error codes

### APIDOC

* Inline Documentation for RESTFUL web APIs

> apiDoc creates a documetation from API annotations in your source code.

- Free
- Less documetation to read over
