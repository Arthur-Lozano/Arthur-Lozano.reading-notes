## Why is the Context API useful?
- The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux

## Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
- Yes components outside of provider can usee it as consumers.
 
## What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
* Theming — Pass down app theme and Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user to name a couple.

## Describe “Context Hell”
- When multiple contest providers are nested and becomes somewhat difficult to read 

## Vocab

* global state
- Without using a library such as redux developers may want to use global state when many components need access to the same stateful information, such as the current user's info or theme settings (light mode or dark mode).

* global context
- Any children inside of context can be a consumer of context.provider and access the state.

* Provider
- Provider allows for the transfer of data from the consumers back to the Provider which will maintain state.

* consumer
- Subscribes to a provider in order to access and potentially change state
