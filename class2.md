# Week Two

## Command Line 

* The command line is also known as the terminal (text based interface to the system/OS)
* There is no need to choose the GUI over the command line or vice versa as both can be utilized together
* Within the terminal is the shell.  The shell is the part of the operating system that will determine how the terminal will perform or look after utilizing commands through it.
* There are various shells available but the most common shell utilized is called (Bash) which stands for *bourne again shell* 
> If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.

## Basic Navigation

### There are various commands to help navigate through the terminal much like using a mouse to navigate through the GUI, I have listed some below

* ls
* pwd
* cd

##  Everything is a file 

* Everything is a file under the hood of Linux (Even a keyboard)
* Linux ignores file extensions and instead looks inside of the file to determine what type of file it is
* Whenever a file or directory is specified on the command line it is actually a path (Directories are special types of files)
