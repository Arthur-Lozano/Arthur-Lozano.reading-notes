- What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
* Sending smaller packets helps with the efficiency of data transfer and the ability to do it successfully.  As opposed to sending a large block of data that might fail and the receiver gets nothing.

- UDP is often referred to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
* Because no connection is needed to be established between the source and the  destination before the tranmission takes place.

- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
* Yes as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs.

- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
* No because a server listens on a single port.

- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
* I think so if we create it to do so
