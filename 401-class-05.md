## Linked Lists

* They are linear data structures

* Linked lists don't need to take up a block of memory but instead can take bytes from various locations which means they can grow dynamically, this is unlike arrays which need contigous blocks of memory.

* Linked lists are dynamic data structures and arrays are static data structures.

> On the other hand, a dynamic data structure can shrink and grow in memory. It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well.

* Linked lists are made up of a series of nodes which are the elements of the list.

* The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node also referred to as the (head)

* All lists need a head because it is our entry point and without it we wouldn't have access, and without it we wouldn't know where to start

* A single node has two parts (data, and a reference to the  next node)

> A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.

* Choosing a type of linked list to utilize depends on the problem at hand

- Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction.  Start at the head and end at the last node which will have a value of null.

- Doubly Linked Lists - there are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node. This is helpful if we want to traverse data structures in more than a single track or direction

> A circular linked list is a little odd in that it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value. Instead, it has a node that acts as the tail of the list (rather than the conventional head node), and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list.

> An O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm. An O(n) function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
