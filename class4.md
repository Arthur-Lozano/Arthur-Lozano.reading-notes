# Week 4

- Notes on the high-level process
- Site navigation should be clear, concise, and selective
- Grouping related information together can make design easier to comprehend 
- cd ~ to go back to root
# Other factors to consider are
 * Closure 
 *  Proximity 
 * Continuance
 * White space
 * Color
 * Borders
 ## Visual contrast is important and items with higher contrast are received and processed first
 ## Wire frames are extremely important and it has get a visual idea of what important information is necessary for a website, it also shows the hierarchy of information
 ## New Vocabulary
- HTML / Markup
- Semantics - syntax wih a specific purpose that can be easily understood 
- Wireframe - the mock up of a future design 
- Personas
- Meta - you put information about the site but it is not visible to users 
- Content - The core of the page
- Element - An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag (most elements have opening and closing brackets, images are self closing)
- Tag - syntax that makes up the page but isn't semantics 
- Attribute (inside opening tag and put within parenthesis)
- Structure vs Presentation - HTML/CSS
## The new element tags make the code within HTML easier to identify as opposed to using attributes with div tags.  
## A html webpage has a lot of important syntax within it's structure some are listed below
## It is important that if a tag is opened such as footer that the tag is also closed after the text such as /footer.  This is important with a lot of html tags but does not mean **All** html tags require this.
## There is also code to help older browsers understand the code
> Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML
- DOCTYPE can also help a webpage render correctly because it is actually able to communicate with the browser and it allows the browser to provide the best service for the specific version of HTML
- Comments in html look like this *<!-- -->*
- ID attribute helps to identify a specific element 
_  The *class* attribute helps to identify several elements as opposed to one like the ID attribute

## The <span> element acts like
## an inline equivalent of the <div>
## element. It is used to either:
## 1. Contain a section of text
## where there is no other suitable
## element to differentiate it from
## its surrounding text
## 2. Contain a number of inline
## elements
