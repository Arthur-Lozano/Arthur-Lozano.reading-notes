## What is growth mindset?
### Growth mindset is the ability to be able to grow utilizing one's drive and craving for knowledge as opposed to just being naturally good at something.
### Growth mindset is a positive example that even though some individual's might be born with natural abilities that make them better suited for a task does not mean that individuals who are not naturally inclined to succeed are completely ruled out from the challenge.

## Growth mind set is the ability to **not** let anything limit your ability to keep growing and learing
# Reminders
- 1. Embrace challenges 
- 2. Be inspired by the success of others 
- 3. Learn for **criticism**.
