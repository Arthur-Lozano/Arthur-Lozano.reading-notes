### The book is divided into three areas (HTML, CSS, and practical)

>People access the web via -
>Browsers - People access websites using software called a web browser.Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

### People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. It is important to remember that various devices have different screen sizes and some have faster connections to the web than others.

### You see through the browsers, website are usually written in HTML and CSS.  There are constant improvements to both HTML and CSS.

### When visiting a website keep in mind the web server hosting it could be anywhere in the world and not necessarily near you.  To find the location of the web server you are utilizing your browser first connects to the DNS (Domain Name Server)

### When connecting to the web it is done using a (ISP)
### Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.  An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

### Elements are used to describe the structure of pages
### Tags tell you something about the information located within them
### Main tags that make up the HTML structure (HTML, BODY, HEAD, TITLE)

*HTML 4 (Released 1997)
*HTML 1.0 (Released 2000)
*HTML 5 (Released 200)

### !DOCTYPE html helps to tell the browser which version of HTML a programmer intends to use. 
### `<!-- words -->` (within brackets will comment out the code)

### ID and Class attributes help change a specific block of code utilizing css
### Block elements will appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
### Inline elements appear to continue on the same line

### The div element will help to group a set of block level elements togeSther in one blok level box.
> The `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either:

### `<iframe>`
### The iframe tag - iframe means inline frame and provides another window within a browser that essentially can be another page within a page.

### the meta element lives within the head and gives a description of the website
### "Escape Characters" will need to be utilized in order to use HTML special characters as plain text such as (<>) greater than or less than signs.


### Identifying and grouping elements
### Comments, meta frames and iframes

# HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)

## HTML5 layout elements
>The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
##  How old browsers understand new elements
###
## Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS
### New HTML elements for layout consist of (body, div, header (nav within header), div for content with other possible tags such as article within, a possible aside tag for more information, and lastly footer)
### Headers and footers are usually used within each page of a website but can be used for pieces within a website as well
>For example, on a page with several blog posts, each individual post can be thought of as a separate section. The `<header>` element can therefore be used to contain the title and date of each individual post, and the `<footer>` might contain links to share the article on social networking sites.
### the `<nav>` element is used to contain the important navigational elements of a webpage.


# HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)

### Narrow down your target audience
### Create fictional visitors from the selected target audience (These fictional visitors can work like a simulation in that they can help the site creator to decide on a color palette or even how much content to put on each page)

### Factor in a consumers key motivations as to why they are visiting your site and try to narrow down the best way to provide that content.  (Is this a necessity or pleasure?)

## After finding out what is necessary for the site it is time to create a sitemap that will not only help users navigate the website but also improve SEO
