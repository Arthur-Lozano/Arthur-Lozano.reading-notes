## Week 1

### Growth Mind Set

- It is important to practice the hard parts and not just the easy everyday programs in order to progress as a developer.  It is important to push ourselves through not only programming what is easy but what we know are our weaknesses. Believing that I can grow and improve will take me a lot farther than worrying or not being confident in myself.  Grit can go a long way when it comes to success and it's not just the results from a test that say you are good enough, it is more about how hard you're willing to work.


- My emotional intelligence seems to be normal but i'm sure there are things i could work on.
