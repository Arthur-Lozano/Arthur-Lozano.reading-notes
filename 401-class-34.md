## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

- Reduce toolkit gives us more control over state and used for efficient Redux development.  It also comes with some of the most used Redux addons such as redux thunk and async logic. Ducks helps to grow a React/Redux app with a files 
system that grows along with the app.  Ducks eliminates the margin for error when importing actions across multiple components which allows more modularity.
## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- Redux Toolkit helps us to write simpler code and provides good default behaviour, error handling, and other streamlined processes to make programming easier for engineers.

## redux toolkit slices

> A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.

- A namespace component is another feature request that is available in React JSX. By using the standard JavaScript syntax approach, which is object property access, this helps us to assign components directly such as <Namespace.Component>, instead of assigning variables to access components that are stored in an object.
