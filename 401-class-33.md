- What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
* Possibly to fire off the async action in the lifecycle method like componentWillMount of one of the higher order functions that wraps our app.

- When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
* The  function that has the action

### Terms

- middleware
* Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. ... Middleware helps developers build applications more efficiently. It acts like the connective tissue between applications, data, and users.

- thunk
* Since redux itself does not allow Async actions we have to depend on something else to help us which is where thunk comes into play.  The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.
