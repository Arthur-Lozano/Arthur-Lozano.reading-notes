# Comparison and logical operators: 150-151, 156, and 157

* == (equal to)
* != (not equal to)
* === (Strictly equal to)
* !== (Strict not equal to)
* '>' (Greater than)
* '<' (Less than)
* '>=) (Great than or equal to)
* '<=' (Less than or equal to)

# Logical Operators
* && Logical and
* || Logical or
* ! Logical not


# loops: 170 - 173, and 176

* For Loop (Run a code a specific amount of times, most common loop)
* While Loop (Loop will continue for as long as the condition stays true)
* Do While (Similar to the while loop; however, it will always run the statements in the curly braces at least once)

## A for loop uses a counter as a condition

* Initialization - Initialization create a variable and set it to 0 (aka 'i', and it also acts as the counter)
* Condition - The loop continues until it reaches a specific number (i<10;>)
* Update - Every time the loop runs the statements in curly braces it adds one to the counter (i++)
