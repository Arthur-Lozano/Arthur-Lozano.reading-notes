## Self driving car

-  I think that self driving cars can be good and bad.  The scenario from the article says what would you do with a self driven car if you might be forced to crash into a bus.  Do you avoid the busy?  Do you have time to take control of your self driven vehicle before its too late?  I think that the algorithm for the self driven car and AI should be able to ensure that you avoid whatever you're gonna hit and be able to calculate the best outcome.  I would trust a an extremely accurate mathematical algorithm to make a better judgment "under stress" as opposed to my simple little brain.

- The next question would be why should that be my choice?  What about the people in the bus?  Honestly I can't answer that part.  Other people on the road should have a say as well but I would still think and AI if not now then eventually would be able to decide an accurate solution to this better than most drivers.
