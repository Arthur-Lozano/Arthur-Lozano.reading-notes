# Reading Redux

- Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?  It is a beter state management system and allows state to be accessed and updated by connected components more efficiently.

- What is the purpose of a reducer?
* A reducer is a function that takes two arguments(state and action).  And returns based on both arguments a new state.

- What does an action contain?
* The action provided will be what/how the state is updated.

- Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
* Yes, because state is immutable and it can't be updated directly.  So we need to always make a copy and save the new copy.  This way we can preserve history to avoid undesirable side effects.


* Term

- immutable state - Is state that cannot be modified after creation so we instead make a copy of it.

- time travel in redux - The ability to step forward and backwards through the state of our application.  Because our state is immutable we can access the previous versions of it.

- action creator - A function that assigns a new action.

- reducer - This is the function that will update state.

- dispatch - A function of the Redux store.  We call store, dispatch to dispatch an actual action.  This is (the only way) to trigger a state change.  In react-redux components never access the store directly but the (connect) does it for us.
