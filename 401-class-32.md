- How granular should your reducers be?
* They should be as granular as necessary to accomplish the apps tasks. There shouldn't be an unnecessary granularity.
> When actions become setters, thunk action creators can become functions that dispatch multiple actions in a row to perform a "state change transaction". Dispatches become too granular and meaningless, leaking state update logic to the thunk action creators functions.

- Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched.
* I think its a pro depending on what your application is aiming to achieve.  

- Name a strategy for preventing the above
* Create reducers for each action or in a manner where they wouldn't fire at the same time unless that was our intention is to have reducers update their specific parts of state.
