# What Google learned from it's quest to build the perfect team

- Working together in teams or collaborating with colleagues has show an improvement in efficiency and work performance. 

> n Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.(Duhigg, 2016)

* The most productive employees 
- Rotate dining companions
- Avoid micro managing 

> The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright. (Duhigg, 2016)

### Successful teams

- Every member spoke about the same amount, every member needs to have a voice and feel comfortable to give their opinion
- had high "average social sensitivities" Each member was able to pick up on the feelings of others via their non-verbal cues

> But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (Duhigg, 2016)

> Rozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make (communication and empathy) — the building blocks of forging real connections — into an algorithm they could easily scale. (Duhigg, 2016).

- Everyone within the team needs a chance to speak and contribute.  It is important that everyone within a group feels free to speak up and to be heard.  Also, psychological safety and emotional conversations are related and they need to accepted.  The closer one feels to a team the better they can express their ideas without worry of rejection or non acceptance.  True freedom and thought of expression allows for growth
