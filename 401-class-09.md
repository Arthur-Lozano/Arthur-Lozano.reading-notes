# Stacks and Queues

- A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes.

- Each node references the next node in the stack but will not reference its previous node.


## Common vocab for a stack

- Push - Nodes or items that go into a stack are usually pushed.

- Pop - Nodes or items removed from a stack are popped.  When pop is being utilized an exception will be raised.

- Top - This is the top of the stack.

- Peek - Peeking allows us to view the value of the Node in the top of the stack.

- isEmpty - Returns true when a stack isEmpty otherwise will return false.


## Queues follow to two concepts:

- FIFO - First item in the queue will be the first item out of the. queue 

- LILO - Last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue


## Enqueue O(1)

- When adding an item to a queue we need to utilize the enqueue action.

-  When adding a new item we need to re-asign the rear reference or the top reference depending.

- Enqueue nodes into the queue as needed.

## Dequeue O(1)

- When removing an item from the queue we need to utilize the Dequeue action.  

## Peek O(1)

- When conducting a peek you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

- It is typical to use `isEmtpy`  before utilizing peek to ensure that a node is not empty.  Or the call can be wrapped in a try catch block. 

## IsEmpty O(1)

- returns front of null
