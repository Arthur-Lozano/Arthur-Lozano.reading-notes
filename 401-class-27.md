- Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()

* useMemo is a React hook that memorizes the output of a function. That is it. useMemo accepts two arguments: a function and a list of dependencies. ... If not, it will return the cached return value, not calling the function. If they have changed, useMemo will call the provided function again and repeat the process

> useReducer()  is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
* Because it will show us that the rules of hooks apply.

- What do custom hooks usually do?
* They are a mechanism to reuse state logic

- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
* useOnlineStatus uses the navigator.onLine property to check the network status to determine if the user is connected to the internet or not.

- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

### First, we're going to import stuff we're going to use and create a function. The next step is to add a useState hook and to define the name of the state - in our case, that's data. Then, we define the function we'll use later on to update the state - setData.

## Terms

- Reducer - A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.
