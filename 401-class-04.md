# Reading class 04

## Three advantages to Test Driven Development
* Kepps focus on the specific part of the app that is being worked on.
* Better Code quality
* Flexible and modular codeforEach

## beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test sweet
- afterEach() runs after every runnable instance 
- beforeEach() runs before each runnable instance

* A good example would be to clear a database.  To initalize a database we could put our function within the beforeEach and to clear it we can put the clear function inside the afterEeach function.

## A downside of Test Driven Development

- slow process
- all members of a team must utilize it
- Tests need to be updated when requirements call for it

## The primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype classes
- The most important difference is that clss defines a type which can be instiatiated at runtime, and a prototype itself is an object instance and the constructor is just a function that returns an object.


## Why Rest?
- Representational state transfer - when the API is called the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. Rest allows us to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

### Functional programming
- Functional programming is a process of building software by creating pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects.  

### object - oriented programming (OOP)
- Object oriented programming is programming based upon the concepts of "objects". OOP tries to emulate real world problems based upon these objects 

### class
- Classes are templates for creating objects.

### super
- The `super` keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

### this
- In most cases the value of (this) is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding).

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
- TDD is a software development process that relies on software requirements being converted to test cases before the software is fully developed.

### Jest

- Jest is a javascript testing framework that is maintained by facebook.  Jest allows us the  test our code.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Continous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. 

### REST

- Representational state transfer - when the API is called the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

### Data Model

- The process of creating a data model by applying formal data model descriptions using data modeling techniques.
