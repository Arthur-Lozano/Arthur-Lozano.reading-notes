## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- The singeleton design pattern restrics the instantiation of a class to a single instance.  This provides coordinated access to a resource throughout a software system. This also provides easier access to this single instatiated class.

- A singleton class can have only one object (instance of the class) at a time

- If we try to instantiate the Singleton class the new variable will point to the first instance.

- I would create classes that would be modularized in order to keep them easy to find and utilize.

- Router Middleware - Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

- Dynamic Module Loading - will load modules when necessary during runtime

- Singleton Pattern - The singeleton design pattern restrics the instantiation of a class to a single instance.

- Mock Testing - Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. I
