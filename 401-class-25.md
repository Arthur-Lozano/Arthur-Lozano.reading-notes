### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- Because we do the routing in React.

## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- outside the browser router

### Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
- Will render content outside the router on all pages

### Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
- Put the self closing component tab outside <Rout />

### Inside a <Route />
- Will render that specific content only for that route

### What does props.children contain?
- We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output
- props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
- props. children . Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children
- Am explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
