## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation


- Big O notation is used to describe performance or complexity of an algorithm.  Big O will describe the worst case scenario and will give us the time and speace complexity of an algorithm.  
- O(1) - will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(N) - Performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- O(NÂ²) - algorithm whose performance is directl proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2^N) - algorithm whose growth will double with each addition to the input connected to the data set.
- Logarithms - Logarithm is the inverse function to exponentation.
