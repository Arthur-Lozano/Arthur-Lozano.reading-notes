# Readings: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda


## Term

* Amazon API Gateway - Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

> Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.


- Serverless Functions
> Serverless computing is an execution model for the cloud in which a cloud provider dynamically allocates—and then charges the user for—only the compute resources and storage needed to execute a particular piece of code. Serverless functions are event-driven, meaning the code is invoked only when triggered by a request

- Cloud Storage

* Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider such as aws, who manages and operates data storage as a service. Eliminates buying and managing our own data storage infrastructure.


- CDN
* A content delivery network refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together which provides fast delivery of internet services.
