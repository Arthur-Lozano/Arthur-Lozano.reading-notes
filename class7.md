>Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you  canreuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements). When you ask a function to perform a task it is called CALLING the function. Pieces of information passed to a function are known as PARAMETERS. A RETURN VALUE is the answer that a function gives.

# EX Function.

# var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';
# function updateMessage() {
# var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
# el .textContent = msg;
# }
# updateMessage(};

## To run a function you use the function name followed by parenthesis().



# Calling functions 

There is no point of creating a function unless it is eventually called into action
