# EJS

## What is EJS?
- What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

### Working with Volumes

- Working with volumes
- Performing a search
- You can perform a volumes search by sending an HTTP GET request to the following URI:
- https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms

* Note: Performing a search does not require authentication, so you do not have to provide the Authorization HTTP header with the GET request
- However, if the call is made with authentication, each Volume will include user-specific information, such as purchased status.

- Additional (Optional query parameters) can be utilized in addition to the standard query paramaters when performing a volumes search.

- (Filter) You can use the filter parameter to restrict the returned results further by setting it the to one of the following values: Partial, full, free-ebooks, paid-ebooks, ebooks.
