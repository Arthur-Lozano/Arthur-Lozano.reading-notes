How computers work

   Computers are made up of various components that all need to be together in order for the computer to work.  These components change on a day to day basis.

What makes a computer, a computer?

Computers take human input and process it with the cpu then display the results to the screen.  What makes a computer so great is that ability to process or think at an extremely faster rate than a human which makes tasks for humans a lot easier.

How computers work - DATA & Binary

 Computers speak in a language which is binary and represented by 1s and 0s.  The pattern of these numbers can be translated to a working language.


Memory, CPU, Input and Output

    Input devices converts physical inputs to binary information
    Memory stores this information
    Cpu processes this information
    Outputs to screen display binary code into pixels, output devices can be lots of different things

Hardware and Software

    Hardware- circuits, wires, chips, speakers, plugs
    Software- is code/programs running on machine
    How does the software and hardware communicate?
    CPU - master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer (The Brain)
    CPU recieves simples commands that tells it which circuit to use to complete a job (add, store, output, etc)
    Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all hardware of a computer
    All current coding languages are designed on top of the binary language
    OS -the interface the user sees
