## What is growth mindset?
### Growth mindset is the ability to be able to grow utilizing one's drive and craving for knowledge as opposed to just being naturally good at something.
### Growth mindset is a positive example that even though some individual's might be born with natural abilities that make them better suited for a task does not mean that individuals who are not naturally inclined to succeed are completely ruled out from the challenge.

## Growth mind set is the ability to **not** let anything limit your ability to keep growing and learing
# Reminders
- 1. Embrace challenges 
- 2. Be inspired by the success of others 
- 3. Learn for **criticism**.

# My reading notes

### Mark down
* Markdown is a great way to change the information within a repo
* There are a lot of resources to help one improve their markdown skills (cheat sheets etc)
* Files that use markdown language can be identified by the end of the file extension *(md)*
* Markdown also allows quotes and images to be inserted 


### GitHub pages

* Github pages are great to stylize information in a repo
* Github pages are a great way to showcase your work because it allows you to create a website with a lot less work than is normally required.


# Week Two

## Command Line 

* The command line is also known as the terminal (text based interface to the system/OS)
* There is no need to choose the GUI over the command line or vice versa as both can be utilized together
* Within the terminal is the shell.  The shell is the part of the operating system that will determine how the terminal will perform or look after utilizing commands through it.
* There are various shells available but the most common shell utilized is called (Bash) which stands for *bourne again shell* 
> If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.

## Basic Navigation

### There are various commands to help navigate through the terminal much like using a mouse to navigate through the GUI, I have listed some below

* ls
* pwd
* cd

##  Everything is a file 

* Everything is a file under the hood of Linux (Even a keyboard)
* Linux ignores file extensions and instead looks inside of the file to determine what type of file it is
* Whenever a file or directory is specified on the command line it is actually a path (Directories are special types of files)
