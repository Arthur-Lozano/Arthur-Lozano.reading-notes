## Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
> The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.

## Vocabulary Terms

- Rendering
* Javascript uses the document object model (DOM) to manipulate the DOM elements. Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser. The DOM establishes parent-child relationships, and adjacent sibling relationships, among the various elements in the HTML file.

- Templates
* JavaScript templates take simple web apps to the next level, keeping your application logic separate from your presentation and your HTML and JS files clean. This course provides a look at popular JavaScript template solutions for modern web apps that consume and display data.

- State
* State is a JavaScript object that stores component's dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don't use it for static React projects.
