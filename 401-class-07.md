# Reading Class 07

- Write the following steps in the correct order:

1 Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
2 Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
3 Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
4 Receive authorization code
5 Receive access token
6 Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
7 Make a request to the access token endpoint


### What can you do with an authorization code?
- Make a request to get an access token

### What can you do with an access token?
- Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests for us

### Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
- Using OAuth is a delegated authorization framework made for REST/APIs, it enables apps to gain limited access or (scopes) to a user's data without giving away their passwords.  It separates authentication from authorization.

## Vocab words

* Client ID - Identifies a unique number associated to a specific user of an app
* Client Secret - A client secret is a secret known only to your application and to the authorization server.
* Authentication Endpoint - is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.
* Access Token Endpoint - A token endpoint must be able to both grant an access token as well as verify an access token.
* API Endpoint - An endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints
* Authorization Code - is what gives users to an application permission to access certain data
* Access Token - Allows a computer to communicate with another computer/server.
