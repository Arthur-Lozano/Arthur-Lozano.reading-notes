# “Images” (pp.94-125)

- Create a seperate folder for images
- `<img>` to add an image to a page
- src tells the browser where the image is located
- alt provides a description of the image just in case the image does not render
- (title) element can also be utilized to provide additional information about an image
- Height and Width attributes can be specified for an image
- (alight) attribute can be used to move the image to the left or right.  CSS is utilized in HTML5
- (top,middle,bottom)

## Three rules when creating images

- Save images in the right format
- Save images at the right side
- Use the correct resolution

> The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.


## Image editing to keep in mind

### Reducing an image
>Example: If your image is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall, you can reduce the size of the image by 50%.
>Result: This will create an image that is quicker to download.

### Increasing an image
> Example: If your image is only 100 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall, increasing the size by 300% would result in poor quality.
> Result: The image will look blurry or blocky.

### Change shape
> Example: If your image is 300 pixels square, you can remove parts of it, but in doing so you might lose valuable information.
> Result: Only some images can be cropped and still make sense.

- Cropping images must be done in the proper way in order to not lose important information that comes along with the image

> When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.

> JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as bitmap. They are made up of lots of miniature squares. The resolution of an image is the number of squares that fit within a 1 inch x 1 inch square area.

- The way computers display images

> computers display images at a resolution of 72 pixels per inch (ppi). Images in print materials (such as books and magazines) are made up of tiny circles called dots. These images are usually printed at a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi).

- Vector images are different than bitmap images and are resolution independent 
- `<figure>` `<figcaption>` created by HTML5 in order to keep an image and it's caption associated

- There are various tools to edit or create images, I prefer the Adobe tools
