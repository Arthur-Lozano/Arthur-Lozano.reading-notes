## What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?
> Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle.

## Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect
- It will help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders.

## Why are functional components preferred over class components?
- If you are writing a presentational component which doesn't have its own state or needs to access a lifecycle hook, a functional component should be used as much as possible. For state management you can use class component.

> A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.
