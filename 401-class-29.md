# Reading

## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
- Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are mainly for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side . Apart from saving data, a big technical difference is the size of data that can be stored.

## Explain 3rd party cookies.
- Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags.

## How do pixel tags work?
- Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.

## Terms

* cookies
- Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.

* authorization
- The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server, usually, but not necessarily, after the server has responded with a 401 Unauthorized status

* access control
- Role-based access control, also known as role-based security, is a mechanism that restricts system access to users using their roles and privileges and permissions. Within an application, roles are created for various user types (e.g., writer or reader).

* conditional rendering
- Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. T
