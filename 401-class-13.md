## What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
- Sockets are created as a bidirectional resources which means they are capable of both sending and receiving).

## Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
- Yes socket.io attaches to an HTTP server in order to serve its own client code.

## What happens when a client emits an event?
- Whoever or whatever .ons with the same event will be able to hear it

## What happens when a server emits an event?
- The clients can receive it

## What happens if a client “misses” an event?
- Unhandled messages are ignored

## How can we mitigate this?
- Utilize some type of error handling

## Socket
- Sockets allow for communication between two different processes

## Web Socket
- Communication protocol that provides a full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## Socket.io
- Enables realtime, bidirectional and even-based communication.  It works on every platform, browser or device.

## Client
- The user
osi mm
## Server
- The central hub for communication

## OSI Model
- A conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

## TCP Model
- A set of standardized rules that allow computer to communicate on a network (the internet)

## TCP
- TCP is a communication standard that enables programs and communication devices to exchange data over a network.

## UDP
- User datagram protocol - a communication protocol used across the internet for time sensitive information.

## Packets

- A packet is a small part of a larger segment or message being set  across a network.

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- TCP, the client, and socket.io

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- Just to work more with socket.io.  Learn how to makes this process simple.
